# Andrzej Bogdo≈Ç - portfolio

Portfolio based on react with hooks and simple Redux store.
The Atomic Design has been used for file storage, with styled-components as CSS-in-JS styling solution.
ThemeProvider has been used for Day/Night modes (saved in localStorage) and ContextAPI for using functions between different components

## Applied solutions

- Redux as global application state
- saving "night mode" into localStorage
- Formik as main form, directly connected into Netlify Forms
- Progressive Web App
- Optimized for Google Lighthouse audit
- Atomic Design
